    "1. Everything runs as expected (no bugs when running cells);\n",
    "2. The output from each cell corresponds to its code (don't change any cell's contents without rerunning it afterwards);\n",

    "4. Fill in all the places that say `YOUR CODE HERE`, or \"**Your answer:** (fill in here)\".\n",
    "5. You **ONLY** change the parts of the code we asked you to, nowhere else (change only the coding parts saying `# YOUR CODE HERE`, nothing else);\n",
    "6. Don't add any new cells to this notebook;\n",
    "7. Fill in your group number and the full names of the members in the cell below;\n",
    "8. Make sure that you are not running an old version of IPython (we provide you with a cell that checks this, make sure you can run it without errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "Failing to meet any of these requirements might lead to either a subtraction of POEs (at best) or a request for resubmission (at worst).\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise you the following steps before submission for ensuring that requirements 1, 2, and 3 are always met: **Restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\\rightarrow$Run All). This might require a bit of time, so plan ahead for this (and possibly use Google Cloud's GPU in HA1 and HA2 for this step). Finally press the \"Save and Checkout\" button before handing in, to make sure that all your changes are saved to this .ipynb file."

    "Every day you are exposed to sequences of data. For example text, video streams, audio, financial time series and medical sensors. Recurrence is therefore an important topic in the field of Machine Learning because it has the potential to solve real-world problems including the types of data above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will learn to:\n",
    " - Preprocess text data sets\n",
    " - Implement a vanilla RNN cell using only numpy\n",
    " - Text generation\n",
    " - Build a recurrent neural network with LSTM using Keras  \n",
    " - Neural machine translation\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Task 1 (Shallow vanilla RNN) and Task 2 (Neural machine translation), are independent from each other. Task 2 asks you to train a NMT, which takes a while (specially without a GPU), so it might be efficient to start with task 2 and leave it running in the background while you solve task 1.\n",

    "### 2.2 Implementing a sequence-to-sequence model <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2.2\"></a>\n",
    "In this section you will define, train and evaluate a sequence-to-sequence RNN architecture with the help of the Keras API.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Defining the architecture <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2.2.1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are going to define the architecture for the translator. There are several possible architectures for performing translation, which is a sequence-to-sequence task (an input sequence, the English sentence, mapped to an output sequence, the Spanish sentence). If you take inspiration from searching the internet, you might come across neural machine translators such as [Google's Neural Machine Translation System](http://tsong.me/blog/google-nmt/). This kind of deep architecture was trained for a week using 100 GPUs, which is completely out of reach for the purposes of this assignment. Instead we will ask you to implement a simpler architecture that, even though it doesn't possess all the important parts of a translation network, still performs acceptably.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture you are required to implement will closely resemble the image shown at the start of this task. First the input sequence is fed to an encoder network, which is in charge of summarizing the entire sequence in its internal memory. This internal memory is then fed to a decoder network, which uses this summarized content to produce the output sequence. Both the encoder and the decoder networks will be comprised of a single LSTM unit, with a memory cell of arbitrary dimension. Since we won't stack LSTM layers, this can be seen as a \"toy\" version of a complete LSTM architecure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the input sequence for each training sentence is a vector with 5 elements, where each element corresponds to the number of that particular word in the vocabulary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because similar word indexes don't correspond to similar words (e.g. index 133 corresponds to 'joke', whereas index 134 corresponds to 'silence'), it's easier to train our network if we map this data to a space where the semantic meaning of the word is related to its geometric position. For instance, we would like the word 'car' to be closer to the word 'bus' than it is to 'tree'. This can be accomplished with the `Embedding` layer module from Keras, which tries to find a suitable representation for positive integers in a higher-dimensional space by using dimensionality reduction techniques in the matrix of co-ocurrence statistics of our input data. This layer can use an already trained mapping (like Word2Vec), but in this exercise we'll train it ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides deciding how to encode the input, there is another important practical remark to be done. Since the decoder network will also be implemented as an LSTM, it will require inputs. According to what was described earlier, the only important data for this network is the memory cell at each time-step. Unfortunately, there is no simple way to create an LSTM cell without inputs (you can, of course, customize the LSTM layer to not receive any inputs), so we'll simply feed zeros as input at each time-step and it's likely that the optimization procedure will tune the decoder weights to disregard this input eventually (because it's completely uncorrelated to the input and the label, so it doesn't help with the prediction at all).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keras tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's necessary to use the [Model class API](https://keras.io/models/model/) for implementing this model (because it has two inputs, the input sequence and the zeros to the decoder). Be sure to familiarize yourself with this way of defining models in Keras.\n",
    "- You can define an LSTM cell using the [LSTM layer](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/#lstm).\n",
    "- The LSTM layer by default outputs only the output for the last time-step, which is great for the encoder part, since we don't care about its outputs anyway. However, for the decoder network we want the outputs at all time steps. To accomplish this, you can set the argument `return_sequences` to `True` when creating the LSTM layer.\n",
    "- You will need to feed the memory cell content of the encoder network at the last time-step to the decoder network. You can ask the LSTM layer to also output its memory cell contents by setting the `return_state` argument to `True` when creating the layer (this makes the LSTM layer output three things: the actual LSTM output and two variables with different parts of the LSTM internal memory cell).\n",
    "- You can specify the initial state of LSTM layers symbolically by calling them with the keyword argument  `initial_state`. The value of `initial_state` should be a tensor or list of tensors representing the initial state of the LSTM layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, implement your sequence-to-sequence architecture in the function `create_model` by following the descriptions of the function.  "
